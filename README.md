# What is the Café Gato?

The Café Gato website is the site of a theoretical cat café created to explore connections between online marketing and computer science. The site features a custom review system that allows visitors to review the location (with reviews stored in a backend SQL database) and an event scheduling system that allows users to schedule gatherings during limited hours. As part of the online marketing aspect, the site also features two games (a Wordle-esque game called "Purr-dle" and an old-school, console-based, cat-themed JRPG called "Not Bubsy 3D"), emphasizing positive user interactions with the site and promoting awareness of the brand.

This repository is the backend site for the Café Gato site.
